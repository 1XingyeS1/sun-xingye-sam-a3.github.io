      So, I booked an MES session at the public clinic in Kreuzberg. It felt strange, almost too casual. Like signing up for any simple procedure. I chose the standard edit, no extras. It was cheap and quick. Outside, a glowing blue sign read “No Pain, Just Peace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The clinic itself was bright and clean. The receptionist didn't say much—just handed me the intake tablet and went back to her screen. I typed in the memory to erase: <span class="popup-key" data-tip="Warsaw frontline, November 2055.">“Warsaw frontline, November 2055.”</span> The simple words made the event feel small and distant, like it wasn't even mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I waited, I noticed the clinic's advertisements looping on a screen. They showed smiling faces, soldiers reunited with families, peaceful and free from past traumas. The message was simple: “Leave the past behind.” But watching that screen, I felt uneasy. Could forgetting be that simple? Could pain be erased without losing something important?
    </p>

      A nurse came out and called my name. I stood up and followed her down a narrow hallway into a small room. It was colder than I expected, and the air had that stale, plastic kind of smell. She told me to take a seat. Then, without much small talk, she started attaching the electrodes to my temples...
    </p>
    <p>
      As she started counting down, something in me hesitated. Not fear exactly, but a kind of resistance. I thought of all the things I had buried deep—faces, places, sounds. Part of me wondered what would be left if those were gone. Then, everything went black.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to, everything around me looked the same. The nurse was standing nearby. She gave me a faint smile and asked how I felt. I didn't know what to say, so I just nodded.
