            But something changed last month.<br><br>

            My daughter Mia had a small role in her school play. She'd been talking about it for weeks, running her lines at the breakfast table, practising in front of the mirror and asking me how she looked in her costume.<br><br>

            On the night of the performance, I sat down in the hall with the other parents. I felt proud of her as I waited to see her come on stage. But then the lights hit—bright, sharp—and for some reason, it hit me the wrong way. It was like something cracked open. One second I was watching a kids' play, the next I was somewhere else entirely. The sounds came back first—shouting, blasts, that deep, sickening thud of the ground giving way.<br><br>

            I don't remember falling. All I know is that when I opened my eyes, Mia was standing over me, crying. That moment stuck with me. After that, I knew I had to be changed.
