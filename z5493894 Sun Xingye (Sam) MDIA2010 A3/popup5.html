      I later found out the clinic was part of a larger network funded by <span class="popup-key" data-tip="Neuroware Corp: the company behind MES, partnered with governments.">Neuroware Corporation</span>. They've been rolling out MES programs globally, marketed as public health, but with silent contracts with local governments. I couldn't help but wonder: was this really about healing, or about quieting dissent?

      The clinic asked me to share my experience. Maybe they expected something positive, a clean before-and-after story. But it hasn't felt that simple to me. MES did help. The panic eased up, and for that, I'm honestly grateful. But even now, I can't shake the sense that something else was left with it. The memories were awful, yesâ€”but they were mine. They reminded me of what I'd survived, and of what others are still carrying.

      If you're thinking about trying MES, please think twice. If your pain is too much, maybe MES will give you some peace. But ask yourself what you'll lose by forgetting. Maybe healing isn't about erasing anything. I don't know if we're meant to forget everything that hurts. We just sort of learn to live with them. I'm still trying, anyway. What I can't stop thinking about is... <span class="popup-key" data-tip="A question of power, agency, and social memory.">who gets to say what stays, and what disappears?</span>
