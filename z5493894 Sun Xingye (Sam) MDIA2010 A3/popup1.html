      I'm Martin Keller (49). I was with the German forces during World War III. In late 2055, my unit was sent to the outskirts of Warsaw. That month was the hardest I've ever lived through. We were under constant fireâ€”missiles, smoke, people screaming in the dark. A lot of us didn't make it out. I was one of the few who did. For 20 years, I've lived with the ghost of that war; the feeling never really goes away...

      People around me suggested <span class="popup-key" data-tip="Memory Edit System: a neural technology to erase or alter traumatic memories.">MES</span>, the Memory Edit System, to erase the trauma. They said it was like a fresh start, an easy way to move on. At first, I refused. I didn't trust the idea of removing something from my mind. What happens if everyone starts wiping away their pain? Does the history that caused it just disappear, too? I'd seen friends who used MES, and they didn't seem the same afterwards. They looked better for sure, but their eyes were blank, like they'd lost something of their life.
