      The days after were smoother. The panic was gone, and my sleep came fast. That should've been a good thing, right? But something felt off. Just… hard to name. Like I was watching my own life from a distance. It's not bad, exactly. I just can't tell if this feeling is relief or just... absence.

      As weeks passed, I realised this wasn't only about me. MES was becoming popular, not just for soldiers with PTSD, but for many people struggling with grief or guilt, especially due to the ecological collapse happening around us. Forests disappeared, rivers dried up, species went extinct... Many choose MES to erase their sadness about losing the natural world, calling it <span class="popup-key" data-tip="Eco-grief therapy: using MES to forget ecological loss.">“eco-grief therapy.”</span> But was forgetting a solution? Or is it just letting us off the hook for the disaster we've all had a hand in creating?

      I started to think about justice and accountability. If everyone forgets their role in destruction or war, how can society learn or change? MES doesn't just remove pain—it removes our responsibility, our ability to question, to demand justice. Without those uncomfortable memories, history becomes easier to rewrite.
